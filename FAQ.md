## How is this different to Sentimental Versioning?

[Sentimental Versioning?](https://github.com/dominictarr/sentimental-versioning)

Sentimental versioning seems mostly intended to mock reasons people don't want to adhere to an objective, machine-interpretable versioning system. It's similar to [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/), a site for publicly shaming popular projects that have avoided a v1 for years.

RomVer seems like a kind of trojan horse solution to people's unwillingness to adopt semver, give people an arbitrary leading number so they can keep their attachment to subjective meaning in version numbers, so that they'll comply with objective requirements about the latter two numbers, with which machines can easily determine when it's safe to upgrade.
