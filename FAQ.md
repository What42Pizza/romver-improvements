## How is this different to Sentimental Versioning?

[Sentimental Versioning](https://github.com/dominictarr/sentimental-versioning) exists mostly to mock anyone who doesn't use SemVer. It demands that people don't use any rules in their versions, while Romantic Versioning does lay out specific rules that you must follow. It's somewhat similar to [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/), a site for publicly shaming popular projects that have avoided a v1 for years. Overall, Sentimental Versioning is meant to be a joke and Romantic Versioning is meant to be taken seriously.
